            <p> This is a paragraph about Pokemons and how they are adorable and how I love them very much. :) Lorem ipsum time. Lorem ipsum. Pickle the Cat says it's nearly dinner time and she would like her cromchies now please, she has been patientily waiting since meowhr which started at 6:30pm which is over 90 whole minutes ago. Poor Pickle. :( Oooh cat impsum or kitten impsum because of course we've made cat ipsum. Amazing. And a sweary one. I have an apple laptop so it will probably be Annoyed TM at me attempting to swear. Why is there 50 shades of ipsum why is (can we stop catering to dog people pls this is the same as always needing to cater to extroverts it annoys me) what was i saying, idk something about swearing and apple. Gaia ty ty and angy.</p>

            <h3>Togepi</h3>
            <p> Togepi is a baby poke and very cute. It's a fairy type and it has a egg shell and then it turns into Togetic when you become good friends, and then if you give it a special stone it becomes a Togekiss which is a very powerful flying fairy.</p>
