                        Training Pokemons in the Nintendo Switch - Pokemon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl is very fun and the pokemon available for training are very adorable. You can either hatch them from eggs, or befriend them if you find them in the wild. They live in little pokeballs, of which there are a variety - including a special friendship pokeball. :) 
                        <br><br>
                        You can teach your Pokemons new moves, and help them level up in their skills. Sometimes, if you bond with them or train them a lot they can grow into stronger versions of themselves too! :D 
                        <br><br>
                        I first started training Pokemons in winter of 2021, and we can either blame Jo or Kieran (or both) for introducing me to my new favorite hobby. Hehehe.<br> </p>
